# Additional Dungeon Assets
This section expands the dungeon creation system with new asset categories: keys, objects, decor, spells, effects, fog of war effects, and miscellaneous elements. These assets enhance dungeon diversity, strategic depth, and immersion, aligning with faction themes (e.g., Undead necrotic effects, Goblin mechanical gadgets). Assets are unlocked via kingdom ranks, Library research, or purchases with currencies (common: Gold, Materials; creator: Popularity Tokens, Death Essence; diver: Loot Coins, Feat Artifacts). Each asset has a point value for difficulty calculation and costs in resources/currencies. The cross-platform editor (PC drag-and-drop, mobile tap-to-place) ensures intuitive placement, with faction bonuses reducing costs or enhancing effects (e.g., Elves -15% on spell costs).

## Asset Unlocks and Costs
- **Unlocks**: Assets range from basic (Rank 1) to epic (Rank 10). Unlocked via kingdom progression, Library research (e.g., for spells), or Market purchases (e.g., decor with Gems). Faction bonuses apply (e.g., Dwarves -15% on mechanical objects).
- **Costs**: Basic assets use common resources (Materials, Gold); advanced assets require creator/diver currencies (e.g., 50 Vote Credits for epic spells). Cosmetic variants cost Gems for aesthetics.
- **Point System**: Assets contribute to dungeon difficulty (e.g., basic key: 3 points, epic fog effect: 20 points). Total points determine level and reward scaling.
- **Voting Integration**: Unique assets (e.g., creative decor or complex effects) boost Uniqueness and Replayability voting scores, increasing creator currencies (e.g., Fame Points).

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **Early Game**: Use basic keys (Iron Key) and decor (Static Skulls) for simple layouts; fog effects (Fog) add challenge with low cost. Focus on common resources (Materials, Gold).
- **Mid Game**: Combine puzzle keys with spells (e.g., Vine Snare + Rune Key) for complex dungeons; use weather effects (Rain) to boost Difficulty votes. Leverage creator currencies (Vote Credits) for unique assets.
- **Late Game**: Craft epic assets (Mythic Shard Key, Toxic Mist) with Mythic Shards; dynamic objects (Shifting Wall) and reward triggers enhance Replayability and Uniqueness scores.
**Balance Notes**: 
- Asset points balance difficulty (e.g., Hazardous Gas Cloud +25 points vs. Static Decor +1 point). 
- Costs scale with rarity: basic assets use common resources, epic assets require diver/creator currencies (e.g., 50 Mythic Shards for Nemesis Key). 
- Faction bonuses enhance efficiency (e.g., Goblins -10% on trap enhancers, Elves +15% on spell effects). 
- Fog of war effects optimized for mobile (low rendering load); UI includes toggle for visibility effects. 
- Voting rewards tied to creative use (e.g., decor + Uniqueness, dynamic objects + Replayability). 
- Cloud sync ensures asset placement persists across platforms.
