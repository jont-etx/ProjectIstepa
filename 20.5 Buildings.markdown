# Buildings
Players build 9 core structures, each with faction-specific names, themes, and functions. Buildings have 5 upgrade tiers unlocking new features, services, or buffs, with costs scaling by resources and kingdom rank. Faction-specific bonuses align with playstyles (e.g., Ogre buildings boost melee/trap durability). Upgrades reward +20 prestige per tier and increase passive common resource generation (e.g., Gold, Mana).

## Ogre Buildings
**Theme**: Brutal, stone-heavy structures with crude, rugged designs (e.g., spiked walls, boulder piles).

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **Early Game**: Upgrade faction-themed Tavern/Market to Tier 2 for hero hiring and trading boosts tailored to faction strengths (e.g., Ogre Grog Hall for melee power). Focus on passive Gold/Materials to build base economy.
- **Mid Game**: Upgrade Library/Blacksmith to Tier 3 for puzzle/gear advantages; use diver/creator currencies for specialization (e.g., Death Essence for traps in Goblin Blast Forge).
- **Late Game**: Max out Bank/Magicians School to Tier 5 for max passive resources (e.g., 50 Mana/day from Elf Arcane Glade); trade currencies for rares (e.g., Replay Shards for nemesis buffs).
Balance Notes: Faction-specific bonuses ensure strategic variety (e.g., Dwarves’ +15% building durability vs. Elves’ +15% puzzle efficiency). Upgrade costs scale to prevent early Tier 5 rushes, requiring rare currencies (Mythic Shards, Feat Artifacts) for late-game unlocks. Passive generation boosts with upgrades (+20% per tier), encouraging investment. Cross-platform UI ensures intuitive upgrade interactions.
