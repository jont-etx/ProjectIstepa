# Kingdom Progression and Ranks
Kingdoms progress through 10 ranks, unlocked by prestige (earned from dungeon explorations, creations, and services). Higher ranks grant access to advanced assets, larger maps, and building upgrades.

**Progression Mechanics**:
- **Prestige Sources**: Dungeon completions (+10-100 based on difficulty), creations (+5 per player completion), services hired (+2 per transaction), building upgrades (+20 per tier).
- **Rank Requirements**: Cumulative prestige (e.g., Rank 1: 0, Rank 2: 500, Rank 10: 50,000).
- **Unlocks**: Per rank, gain new assets (e.g., Rank 3: Basic puzzles; Rank 7: Epic monsters), dungeon size bonuses (+16x16 max), and building upgrade tiers (e.g., Tier 3 at Rank 4).

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **Early Ranks (1-3)**: Basic buildings/resources; upgrade faction-themed Tavern/Market to Tier 2 for income.
- **Mid Ranks (4-6)**: Specialized assets and building upgrades (Tier 3-4); emphasize multiplayer services.
- **Late Ranks (7-10)**: Complex feats and Tier 5 faction-themed buildings; optimize for high-reward dungeons.

**Balance Notes**: Prestige grind is mitigated by events (double prestige weekends) and achievements (e.g., "First Dungeon Creator: +500 prestige"). Building upgrades require rank gates to pace progression. Cross-platform syncing ensures progress carries over devices.
