Trade Empire Game Design Document - World Setup
World Setup

Map: Procedurally generated with varied terrain (plains, rivers, coasts, mountains) and city nodes (home base and NPC cities). Each node has unique goods demand profiles (e.g., high food demand in rural nodes, mail in urban nodes). Maps scale with player count (16â€“64), ensuring balanced node distribution and sufficient trade opportunities.
Starting Location: Players select a home base node from available city nodes. A buffer zone (e.g., 5 km radius) prevents other players from claiming nearby nodes for the first in-game day (24 hours real-time or ~2 hours with 12x time compression), allowing initial route establishment.
Starting Resources: Players begin with $5,000 to secure their home base and establish initial transport routes (e.g., dirt roads for carts, river docks for rafts). This ensures accessibility for new players while enabling early expansion.
