Sea Navigators: 10% faster water transport (speed bonus), ideal for river and ocean routes.



Sky Traders: 15% reduced cost for air transport units and airports, accelerating air-based expansion in later ages.



Route Masters: 10% increased capacity for all transport modes, boosting overall goods delivery.



Swift Couriers: 10% reduced delivery time for mail and passengers, excelling in high-priority transport.
