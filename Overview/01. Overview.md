Trade Empire Game Design Document - Overview
Overview
A streamlined real-time strategy (RTS) and massively multiplayer online (MMO) transportation game where players build a trade empire by managing logistics across a dynamic world map. Starting from a chosen home base, players transport goods between city nodes (home base and NPC cities) to meet demands and grow trade influence. The game supports 16 to 64 players per session, with AI-controlled entities to fill gaps if the player count is low (e.g., <32). Progression occurs through 8 simplified technological ages, focusing exclusively on transportation and logistics to keep gameplay semi-simple yet engaging. No production or storage mechanics are included, emphasizing transport over node growth or resource generation. The game balances accessibility with strategic depth, incorporating diplomacy, hostile takeovers, and dynamic node interactions to create a competitive yet cooperative trade environment.
