Trade Empire Game Design Document - Research System

Research System

Research drives progression through 8 ages, focusing solely on transportation and logistics to enhance units, routes, and efficiency. Technologies are fueled by research points (RP), currency, and goods imported to the home base. No production, building, industry, or economy techs are included to maintain simplicity and align with the transport-only focus.

Research Mechanics





Time-Based Ages: Each age lasts ~8 hours real-time (or ~40 minutes with 12x time compression). Technologies are age-locked to ensure balanced progression.



Research Points (RP): Generated by transport hubs (e.g., depots in Age 1, logistics centers in Age 5), scaling with active routes (e.g., 1 RP/hour per route, max 50 RP/hour).



Goods for Research:





Importing specific goods to the home base boosts research speed (e.g., wood for early techs, electronics for later techs).



Goods are sourced from other nodes (players or NPCs) via trade or transport.



Example: Steam Trains requires 50 iron; importing 50 iron reduces research time by 15%.



Costs: Technologies require RP, currency, and goods (e.g., 50 RP, $200, 20 wood).



Time: Research takes ~20 minutes per 50 RP, reduced by goods imports (up to 50% reduction) or faction bonuses (e.g., Sky Tradersâ€™ 20% faster air research).



Collaboration: Allies can share RP, splitting rewards evenly (e.g., 100 RP split as 50/50 for two players), encouraging cooperative strategies.



Tech Tree: ~5 technologies per age, ~40 total, with simple dependencies within the same or prior ages to avoid complexity.
