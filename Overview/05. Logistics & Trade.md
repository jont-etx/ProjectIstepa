Trade Empire Game Design Document - Logistics and Trade Influence
Logistics and Trade Influence

Logistics Focus: Core gameplay revolves around transporting goods between city nodes to meet demand, optimizing routes for speed, capacity, and cost to maximize trade influence. Players manage transport units and infrastructure (e.g., roads, docks, airports) to build an efficient network, with no focus on production or storage to keep the game simple.
Goods:
Passengers: Varying needs (e.g., speed for business travelers, comfort for tourists). High-priority, boosts node satisfaction significantly (2x influence multiplier).
Mail: High-priority, low-weight cargo requiring fast delivery (e.g., under 2 hours in-game, 1.5x influence multiplier).
Consumer Goods: General cargo (e.g., electronics, clothing) with moderate priority and higher volume (1x influence multiplier).
Food: Perishable goods needing timely delivery to avoid spoilage (e.g., 4-hour in-game window, 1.2x influence multiplier).


Trade Influence:
A score reflecting a player’s control over trade routes and goods flow, calculated as: Influence = (Goods Delivered × Demand Priority) + (Route Efficiency × 0.5) + (Nodes Connected × 100).
Goods Delivered: Volume of goods meeting demand (e.g., 100 units of food = 100 points).
Demand Priority: Multiplier based on goods type (mail = 1.5x, food = 1.2x, consumer goods = 1x, passengers = 2x).
Route Efficiency: Based on speed and cost (e.g., delivering faster than required time adds a bonus, calculated as % under time × 10).
Nodes Connected: Bonus for each node in the player’s network (100 points per node).


Home base doubles influence gains (2x multiplier) compared to NPC nodes, incentivizing its development.
Influence unlocks research boosts (e.g., +10% RP generation at 1000 influence) and determines leaderboard rankings.


Node Dynamics:
Nodes grow passively when demands are met consistently (e.g., 80% of demands fulfilled over 12 in-game hours), increasing demand volume (e.g., from 100 to 200 units) and variety (e.g., adding mail to a food-only node).
No manual node upgrades or production investments; growth is automatic to simplify gameplay, with tiers (Village → Town → City → Hub) unlocking higher demands and rewards.
Node tiers:
Village: 1–2 goods types, low volume (e.g., 100 units).
Town: 2–3 goods types, medium volume (e.g., 300 units).
City: 3–4 goods types, high volume (e.g., 600 units).
Hub: All goods types, very high volume (e.g., 1000 units).


Growth triggers are based on consistent demand fulfillment, with no player-controlled production or storage to maintain focus on transport.
