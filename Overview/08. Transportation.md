Transportation

Transport Modes:
Land: Roads (dirt, paved, rail) for carts, wagons, trains, trucks.
Water: Rivers and ocean routes for rafts, rowboats, ships, freighters.
Air: Airports for airships and planes (unlocked in later ages).


Ages:
8 technological ages, each unlocking advanced transport options and infrastructure.
Age 1: Basic land (carts) and water (rafts).
Age 8: Advanced land (high-speed trains), water (mega-freighters), air (jet planes).
Ages last ~8 hours real-time (or ~40 minutes with 12x time compression), with technologies locked to each age to pace progression.


Transport Units:
One unit per mode per age, with simplified stats: capacity (goods units), speed (km/h), cost ($).
Early ages (1–3) emphasize land, mid-ages (4–5) water, later ages (6–8) air.
Units require infrastructure (e.g., roads for carts, docks for rafts, airports for planes).
