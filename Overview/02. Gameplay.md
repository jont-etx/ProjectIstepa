Trade Empire Game Design Document - Gameplay Loop

Gameplay Loop





Transport: Establish routes to deliver goods from supply nodes to demand nodes, meeting time and volume requirements (e.g., 100 units of food in 4 hours).



Optimize: Upgrade transport units and infrastructure (e.g., from dirt roads to rails) to improve speed, capacity, or cost-efficiency.



Expand: Connect new nodes to access higher demands and increase trade influence, expanding the network.



Trade: Negotiate with NPCs or players to secure goods for demands or research (e.g., trading food for iron to unlock steam trains).



Research: Unlock age-specific transport technologies to enhance logistics (e.g., faster trains, larger ships).



Grow Influence: Build a dominant network by connecting nodes and fulfilling demands efficiently to climb the leaderboard.



Win Conditions:





Trade Dominance: Achieve 75% of the map’s total trade influence, controlling the majority of trade flow.



Hostile Takeover: Purchase controlling shares (51%) of in-debt players’ networks if their balance falls below $0, seizing their home base.



Last Standing: Be among the last 10% of players (e.g., 1–6 for 16–64 players) after bankruptcies eliminate others.



Highest Score: At Age 8’s end, the highest score (wealth + influence + routes) wins if no other condition is met.
