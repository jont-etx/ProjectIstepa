help me write up a game idea project plan. We'll need to really expand on this as we develop the idea.

I want to create a voxel/isometric based multiplayer dungeon creator game. The concept is that you are in control of a kingdom building it from resources you gather from dungeons you lead your heroes through and the rewards you gain from doing so, as well as resources you buy from or hire other players for. In addition you can create dungeons of your own for other players to play through, also resulting in resources you can use to grow your kingdom or dungeon levels, rewards and avaialble assets for you dungeon.

Your Kingdom:
You grow your kingdom by earning prestige, building buildings, and offering services that other players can hire you for. More prestige also encourages new heroes to visit your kingdom, of which you can hire.

Depending on the rank of your kingdom you gain access to different pieces, levels, monsters, traps, and other things the player can use to create a dungeon of your own.

There are multiple currencies/resources each with their own uses. you use to build your dungeons and kingdom. Iron, Wood, Stone, Copper, Gold, Crystals, Gems, Mythril, Artifacts, Runes, and Manuscripts.

Dungeons can consist of monsters to fight, puzzles, and other special feats; players need to complete/defeat these to beat a dungeon. These can all be manipulated/set/placed by the dungeon creator.

There will be several buildings players can build in their kingdom (renamed and adjusted for each faction)
Tavern (for hiring heroes)
Jeweler
Library
Blacksmith
Market
Bank
Magicians school
Archeologist
Carpenter

Factions:
There are several factions, each has a weakness and each has a strength. Each also has a nemesis faction. Each faction will have its own tileset for dungeons. Going up against your heroes nemesis will both be more difficult, but also allow for better chances at better rewards.

Ogres (Nemesis: Nature)
Trolls (Nemesis: Mythical) 
Goblins (Nemesis: Dwarves)
Humans (Nemisis: Undead)
Elves (Nemesis: Trolls)
Dwarves (Nemesis: Ogres)
Undead (Nemesis: Elves)
Mythical (Nemesis: Dwarves)
Nature (Nemesis: Human)

Maps:
Kingdom is a 128 x 128 tile map, free placement for building the kingdom

Dungeons:
There are 10 difficulty/reward levels, starting at level 1 with 32x32 and increases by 16x16 for each level. creators can size any way they'd like up to the maximum in their level + any bonus unlocks. the minimum size is 32x32 and all resizes must go up in increments of 16 in any one direction if desired. a player could do 48x1024 in theory if they wanted to or 256x256, 256x32 or any other varation they might want; they are not required to hit the maximum size available.

Depending on the level available, the assets the creator has to use and the amount of assets placed, the difficulty of the level changes. Each asset has a ranking/point system that is used to set the basic difficulty of the system and in turn the rewards that the dungeon can reward. rewards will be random in nature with percentages to increase their chances.

The game is to be completely free to play with every aspect of it earnable through achievements, in game events with enough in game time and effort everything is achievable. However, when playing free to play you are allowed to only to choose from 1 of three different factions and you have to earn/achieve unlocks for the other remaining factions. However, with that said, I want there to be an option for players to purchase different themes/cosmetic things that can be applied to dungeons, kingdoms, assets and heroes.
