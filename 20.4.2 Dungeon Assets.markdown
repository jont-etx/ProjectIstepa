# Dungeon Assets
Dungeon assets are the building blocks for creating custom dungeons, allowing players to design unique challenges. Assets are unlocked through kingdom ranks, research in buildings (e.g., Library for puzzles), purchases with currencies (e.g., Popularity Tokens for traps), and faction-specific bonuses (e.g., Goblins excel in traps). Assets have point values for difficulty calculation and costs in resources/currencies. Faction-themed variants enhance replayability (e.g., Ogre monsters have high health). Assets are categorized into tiles, monsters, traps, portals, triggers/logic, puzzles, and areas of influence. Cross-platform editor tools ensure intuitive placement (drag-and-drop on PC, tap on mobile).

## Asset Unlocks and Costs
- **Unlocks**: Assets start at basic (Rank 1) and advance to epic (Rank 10). Faction bonuses reduce costs (e.g., Dwarves -15% on mechanical traps). Some require specific currencies (e.g., Replay Shards for replayable puzzles).
- **Costs**: Base in common resources (Materials, Gold); advanced use creator/diver currencies (e.g., 50 Death Essence for undead traps).
- **Point System**: Each asset adds points to difficulty (e.g., basic monster: 5 points, epic puzzle: 50 points). Total points determine level/rewards.
- **Customization**: Cosmetic skins (purchased with Gems) alter visuals without affecting gameplay (e.g., neon Goblin traps).

## Tiles

**Strategic Considerations**:
- **Early Game**: Use basic tiles/monsters for simple dungeons; unlock traps with Popularity Tokens for lethality.
- **Mid Game**: Combine triggers/logic with puzzles for uniqueness votes; use areas of influence to boost replayability (e.g., Nature buff zones for adaptive runs).
- **Late Game**: Craft epic assets with Mythic Shards (e.g., Dwarf boss with logic gates); mix faction assets for hybrid dungeons.
**Balance Notes**: Asset points ensure fair difficulty (e.g., epic monster +50 points). Costs scale with rarity (basic: common resources, epic: diver/creator currencies). Faction bonuses reduce costs (e.g., Goblins -10% on traps). Cross-platform editor supports voxel placement with snap-to-grid for mobile precision.
